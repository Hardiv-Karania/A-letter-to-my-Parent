        Dear Mum & Dad....</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>As I am growing up, I realize just how much you did for me. And, for that, I need to truly thank you.</p>
      <p>Dad, thank you for telling me what I am capable of. For giving me the support that I needed to build a dream to chase after. And for believing that I have the talent to reach my goals.</p>
      <p>Mom, thank you for passing on your belief in greater things that are entirely out of my control. That everything happens for a reason, and we will one day figure out why. That there are moments we experience that provide comfort and a sense of self that we can not explain.</p>
